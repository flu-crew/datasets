Swine H1 GenBank sequences were pulled into octoFLUdb on 2023-06-12, classified and annotated. 1A.1.1.3 (alpha-del) HA sequences associated with whole genome sequenced strains were then queried from octoFLUdb on 2023-06-15 and collection dates were restricted to January 1, 2013 - May 31, 2023.

The HA sequences were aligned using MAFFT and an HA phylogenetic tree was built using FastTree and rooted using TreeTime.

Reassortment analysis between HA and NA segments was conducted using TreeSort and representative strain selection was performed using PARNAS (see manuscript Methods for more details.)
